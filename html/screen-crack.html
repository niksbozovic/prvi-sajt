		<h1><a href="../index.html">niks božović</a> / a  crack, a mistake, ever-expanding, there’s no end in sight. a new world. just a minute ago we lived in a different world. looking for stability in “unprecedented” times is futile, sometimes there just aren’t answers and you’re meant to continue on like nothing happened, like your whole world hasn’t changed, like everything’s the same. i just want to live in a moment, separated from time, from history, from future. but i know that that’s impossible.
		<br><br>
		what i create comes from those little moments, from my fears, my hopes, my dreams, from collective pasts. this particular idea came from a history of broken technology, from future e-waste, from something i can’t fix, at least not yet.
