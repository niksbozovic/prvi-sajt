		<h1><a href="../index.html">niks božović</a> / 

			last year i came out as trans and changed my name. to celebrate that, i cut up my old id card into the tiniest pieces, saying goodbye to a <em> false niks </em>, tried to start anew. so, i wanted to use that false and wrong identity as a part of an art project.

				next week i'm restarting my visits to a gender therapist and i'm unbelievably excited for that. but, i'm also scared. what if all i've been doing has been lying to myself and to others? do i need to apologize to everyone for me actually being cis? am i just faking it? but then again, why would i want the dysphoria which has become an active part of my life? i'm hoping that everything will be ok. /
